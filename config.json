Our Curaçao eGaming licence requires us to maintain strict player protection standards, and we go beyond the minimum requirements. iLucki Casino provides a comprehensive suite of responsible gaming tools accessible directly from your account dashboard — no need to contact support to activate them. Players can set daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limits that prevent overspending before it becomes a problem. Additionally, wager limits and loss limits are available to help maintain full control over your gambling activity at all times.<\/p>\n\n<ul style=\"padding-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px; list-style-position: outside;\">\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.6; display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;\"><strong>Deposit Limits:<\/strong> Set daily, weekly, or monthly caps on how much you can deposit. Changes to increase limits require a 24-hour cooling period to prevent impulsive decisions.<\/li>\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.6; display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;\"><strong>Reality Check Reminders:<\/strong> Configure automatic pop-up notifications at set time intervals during gameplay to remind you how long you've been playing and how much you've wagered.<\/li>\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.6; display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;\"><strong>Cool-Off Periods:<\/strong> Take a short break from gambling by activating a cooling-off period of one week, one month, three months, or six months. Your account remains accessible for withdrawals during this period.<\/li>\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.6; display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;\"><strong>Self-Exclusion:<\/strong> For players who need a more decisive break, self-exclusion locks your account for six months, nine months, or one full year. During self-exclusion, you cannot log in or make new deposits, so please withdraw your balance beforehand.<\/li>\n  <li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px; line-height: 1.6; display: list-item; list-style-type: disc;\"><strong>Direct Links to Help Organisations:<\/strong> We provide direct links to internationally recognised responsible gambling organisations including GamCare, Gamblers Anonymous, and BeGambleAware on our dedicated Responsible Gaming page, available 24\/7 to players globally.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>We also implement strict age verification protocols to prevent underage gambling. All players must verify their identity and age during the KYC process before making any withdrawal. Our self-assessment test helps players reflect on their gambling habits, and our support team is trained to recognise and assist players who may be experiencing gambling-related difficulties. At iLucki Casino, we believe that sustainable, enjoyable gaming is the foundation of everything we do — and our responsible gaming tools are here to make sure every player's experience remains a positive one, wherever in the world they play.<\/p>\n"

E-wallet withdrawals via Skrill, Neteller, and Zimpler are typically processed within 1-2 hours of approval, while cryptocurrency withdrawals to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin wallets are dispatched within the same timeframe — often in under an hour for verified accounts.

However, our VIP programme substantially increases these limits — see our VIP section below for full details.

The verification process typically takes under 24 hours and only needs to be completed once. Required documents include government-issued photo ID, proof of address (utility bill or bank statement dated within three months), and payment method verification where applicable.<\/p>\n\n<h3>Welcome Bonus: Up to €300 + 150 Free Spins<\/h3>\n<p>New players at iLucki Casino are welcomed with one of the most rewarding sign-up packages available globally — a two-part welcome bonus totalling up to €300 in bonus funds plus 150 free spins spread across your first two deposits.
